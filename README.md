# [SDF08] Build Your Portfolio MVP

This is the readme file for the CodeSpace Pets Instagram project 

## Description

The purpose of the project was to code along with the scrimba project, in order to create an MVP portfolio.  

## Design Choices 

Seeing as though we had the UX/UI desing provided, there wasnt much design choices i needed to make.

The few choices i did make had to do with the stylng of the buttons, as i went with my own styling and added some finness. 

## Features 

Overall i was quite pleased with the way the MVP porfolio came out, the features i am most proud of are: 

* the burger menu, learning how to do that and making it work.
* the styling on my button. 

## Technologies Used 

* CSS for styling the page 
* Javascript to create the functionality for my burger menu

## Loom Video Link
