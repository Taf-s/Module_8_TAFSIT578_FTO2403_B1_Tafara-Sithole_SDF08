# [SDF08] Build Your Portfolio MVP

This is the readme file for the MVP portfolio project 

## Description

The purpose of the project was to code along with the scrimba project, in order to create an MVP portfolio.  

## Design Choices 

Seeing as though we had the UX/UI design provided, there wasnt much design choices I needed to make.

The few choices I did make had to do with the styling of the buttons, as I went with my own styling and added some finness. 

## Features 

Overall I was quite pleased with the way the MVP portfolio came out, the features I am most proud of are: 

* the burger menu, learning how to do that and making it work.
* the styling on my button. 

## Technologies Used 

* CSS for styling the page 
* Javascript to create the functionality for my burger menu
